# DATA3888 Discipline 1 Assessment - Predicting Coral Bleaching

Hello! This is a project I worked on in my 3rd year of university. 

This was for one of my individual assessments as part of the data science capstone unit, where I had my first go at working with coral reef data in the Great Barrier Reef.

The assignment was essentially a "mock client report" where I help mock marine scientists address the research findings of a published research study.

The final html report consists of:

1. Visualising coral bleaching spatially.

2. Assessing different approaches to predicting coral bleaching.
